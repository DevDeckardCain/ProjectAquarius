# ProjectAquarius
The goal of Project Aquarius is to create the worlds fastest archival software. The goal is to create a piece of software for people to use to store all of their media, having it manage all aspects. It will find and fetch, compress, embed metadata, convert formats, detect fakes, remove trailers, get lyrics and more all from an ultra light weight user interface, powered by the fastest HTTP server around.

It can scale from a single user with a couple dozen entries, to hundreds of thousands of users per day, spanning accross multiple machines. With built in REDIS, Neo4J and MeiliSearch support, the system grows with you, making management of the software a piece of cake.

The project is currently unreleased and this repo is being prepared so when it does get released all materials will be available to get started with it right away.
